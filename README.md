# RedRyder Rocket
A simple, low-budget model rocket made from a handful of 3D-printed parts and half of a paper towel roll. This project is all about keeping things lightweight and accessible while encouraging creativity, experimentation, and hands-on learning. i used a program called OpenRocket Simulator to make sure that the rocket would work well and that the wheight and thrust would work together for the optimal flight. it features a nose cone with a snap swivel base so it can easily be removed to either hold a payload of a quail egg or a telemetry unit. it also includes fins prefectly made to have the rocket fly strait. the last part if this rocket i designed is the motor holder which is two circles connected with two paper clips to hold the motor bridges in place. heres a picture of the rocket fully assembled.
